# Dispute letter

Dear YouTube Support Team,

I am writing to dispute the blocking of my video "Dracula by Bram Stoker" on YouTube. The book is a classic piece of literature and is in the public domain, sourced from Project Gutenberg. https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/345 I have used Google's text-to-speech technology to synthesize the voice for the video.

I understand that your system may have flagged the video for copyright infringement, but I assure you that no such infringement has taken place. The text of "Dracula" is freely available to the public and I have not used any copyrighted material in creating my video.

I request that you unblock the video and reinstate it to my channel. I have a deep appreciation for classic literature and I believe that my video helps to preserve and share these important works with a wider audience.

Thank you for your time and consideration in this matter. I look forward to your prompt resolution.

Sincerely,
Natapone Charsombut
