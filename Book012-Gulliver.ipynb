The ship should be very small compared to the man and the people. The man should be dressed in sailor attire and have a look of disbelief on his face. The people should be dressed in medieval-style clothing and be less than six inches tall. In the background, there should be a glimpse of the island's landscape, featuring trees and hills.\n",
